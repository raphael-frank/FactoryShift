# Factory Shift
<h3>Itch.io Page: https://knifeuine.itch.io/factory-shiftÂ </h3>

Factory Shift was created during my university's Semester GameJam (June 2023). It is a 2D side-scrolling factory game where you have to place different factories to process various ingredients and deliver them to their destination.

The game was developed within 42 hours using the Unity Engine by a team of six people. I programmed the random level generator and the win conditions. Additionally, I used inheritance to create the logic for the factory machines.
